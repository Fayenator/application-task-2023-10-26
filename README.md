### GitHub

I made two additional branches and merged via pull-requests

### Data Acquisition

I have never worked with MQTT and realized I did not have enough time, so I skipped this step.

### API Development

I set this up via Serverless (https://www.serverless.com/), as it works well with AWS and is quite easy and quick.

### Cloud Provider

serverless works well with aws Lambda, so that's what I chose, together with DynamoDB, of course. Alternatively, since temperature data is time-based using something like the AWS Timestream might have worked better?.

## Data Processing

Did not have time to work on this.

### Visualization

I did not have time for this, but an AWS service like Managed Grafana or Quicksight might have worked.
